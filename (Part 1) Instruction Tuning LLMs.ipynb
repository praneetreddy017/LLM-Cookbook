    "Every organization these days is rushing to develop their own LLM. If that is not an option for you but you want to leverage LLMs capabilities for tasks such as Q&A, you are in the right place. In this notebook we will explore instruction tuning an LLM over our own data. More specifically, we will be leveraging the Q&A capabilities of LLMs to classify sentences based on a set of instructions the user provides.\n",
    "\n",
    "But before we dive deeper, we need to understand what Instruction Tuning is all about. To put it briefly, Instruction Tuning is the method of training the model over to perform an NLP task in a certain way by structuring the data in the form of instructions.\n",
    "\n",
    "For Example:<br>\n",
    "**Instruction: Read the Context below and answer the Question based by picking from the Choices provided below<br>\n",
    "Context: The Clinician said, \"His brother is homeless\"<br>\n",
    "Question: \"In the clinician\\'s opinon, was the person themself homeless?\"\"<br>\n",
    "Choices: Yes; No<br>\n",
    "Answer:** **<font color=red>No</font>**\n",
    "\n",
    "The text highlighted in **bold** will constitute the data portion and the text highlighted in **<font color=red>red</font>** is what was commonly refer to as label in traditional Machine. So that's about what we need to know about the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more information regarding the format of the prompt/context, please read this research paper: **Context-faithful Prompting for Large Language Models**: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.11315.pdf\n",
    "\n",
    "You may be wondering that it would be computationally expensive to train an LLM. While that is true, we can circuvent this issue with the help of what is referred to as Parameter Effecient Fine-Tuning (PEFT). Using PEFT, we only need to train a portion of the model weights and not the entire model itself.  "
